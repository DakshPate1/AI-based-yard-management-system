# Container Yard Optimization Project

Welcome to the Container Yard Optimization project! This repository contains the code and models used to optimize the arrangement of containers in a container yard using various machine learning techniques and a genetic optimization algorithm. This README provides an overview of the project, the process followed, and the structure of the files in the repository.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of container yard management by finding optimal arrangements for containers. The project explores different machine learning models to predict container movements and uses a genetic optimization algorithm to find the best possible placement of containers.

## Process

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (`modelmaking.ipynb`):** This Jupyter Notebook contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and the creation of predictive models to understand container movements.

2. **Model Selection (`modelmaking.ipynb`):** In this section of `modelmaking.ipynb`, various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict container movements. The models are tested on historical data to determine their accuracy and effectiveness.

3. **Genetic Algorithm (`snydercut.ipynb`):** This Jupyter Notebook implements a genetic optimization algorithm. It focuses on optimizing the arrangement of containers in the yard to minimize retrieval time and improve overall yard efficiency.
